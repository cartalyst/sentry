### Finding Users

Finding users can sometimes be difficult and harsh, well, Sentry provides you
simple methods to find your users.

----------

#### Exceptions

##### Cartalyst\Sentry\Users\UserNotFoundException

If the provided user was not found, this exception will be thrown.

----------

#### Get the Current Logged in User

Returns the user that's set with Sentry, does not check if a user is logged in
or not. To do that, use [`check()`]({url}/authentication/helpers#check-if-the-user-is-logged-in) instead.

##### Example

	try
	{
		// Get the current active/logged in user
		$user = Sentry::getUser();
	}
	catch (Cartalyst\Sentry\Users\UserNotFoundException $e)
	{
		// User wasn't found, should only happen if the user was deleted
		// when they were already logged in or had a "remember me" cookie set
		// and they were deleted.
	}

	$users = Sentry::findAllUsers();
